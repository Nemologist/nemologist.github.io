**What did you do?**  
For exactly 30 days I have tried not to actively listen to any music. So no Spotify, no YouTube, and did I mention NO SPOTIFY?  
  
**You cheated, didn’t you?**  
Well, only when I had to. After half of the time was finished, I was invited to a piano concert and didn’t want to miss out on that. Some movies I watched featured long musical scenes and at other times friends wanted to listen to a specific song with me. I was allowed to listen to ambient rainfall when my coworkers got too annoying. That being said, I probably reduced my music consumption by more than 90%

**Why did you do that?**  
I want to try more new stuff and see how it affects my productivity, sleep, etc.

**Well, did it?**  
Productivity-wise I felt that I was less productive during the day at work but more productive in the evening. Listening to music often helps me push trough work that I don’t really want to do and makes boring tasks much more enjoyable. On the other hand, I can certainly concentrate better without music and I might has completed some hard tasks faster. After coming home from work, I often just lean back and listen to music continually without really doing anything. As I no longer had this option, I had much more time on my hand which I could use on various projects – like writing blog articles. Sleep-wise, I think I had a slightly easier time dozing off. Before, I sometimes had the impression (as confirmed by my Fitbit) that listening to music late at night gets my heart rate up and leaves me restless.

**Was it fun?**  
No, not at all. I was actually really surprised how much I missed music. Remembering a specific song and just not being able to listen to it was far more unpleasant than I had anticipated. After about 2 weeks, I started dreaming about opening Spotify and failing the experiment.

**Anything else you noticed?**  
I started singing in the shower. On the way to work. At work when I was alone in the room. I don’t consider myself a music aficionado at all, but apparently, I really needed some melody in my life.

**Will you continue doing it?**  
No. I might consider blocking Spotify before 12 in the morning and after 9 in the evening, but that’s about it.
